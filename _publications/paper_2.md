ABSTRACT
---
A series of bender element tests was carried out to investigate the variation of small-strain stiffness (Gmax) of sand–granulated rubber mixtures under long-term loading. Comparisons were made using two different host sands: a non-crushable material called Sydney sand and a crushable material composed of completely decomposed volcanic rock (CDV). The test results suggested that, at the selected stress states in the study (mean effective confining stress ranged from 250 to 333 kPa), the influence of creep on the stiffness of the pure sand specimens was more pronounced for CDV compared with Sydney sand and the presence of rubber amplified creep effects on both types of mixtures. The influence of creep on Gmax was therefore associated with two major mechanisms: the increased compressibility of specimens predominantly because of grain crushing (contribution of sand fraction), and the increased
