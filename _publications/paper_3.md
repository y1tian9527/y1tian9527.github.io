ABSTRACT
---
The contact problem of soft-rigid interfaces is investigated in this study performing micromechanical-based experiments on sand (rigid) grains sliding against granulated (soft) rubber and by incorporating the Mindlin-Deresiewicz model. The analysis suggested that modifications of the theoretical model are necessary by taking into account, quantitatively, the deformable nature of the soft particles in terms of self-deformations during sliding. Interface friction, tangential stiffness and microslip displacement are analyzed and an attempt is made to provide inter-correlations among different contact parameters, incorporating experimental stiffness and realistic displacement thresholds into the theoretical model.
